Despite this view of the Prime Minister of Australia, people all around the world are in fact apologizing for things for which they are not personally responsible. Such apologies are frequently made by leaders of groups for perceived transgressions by members of their groups against non-members. Thus Pope John Paul II apologized in 2000 for the actions and inactions of the Catholic Church in relation to the Holocaust, and the former US President Bill Clinton apologized in 1998 for the slave trade. As the second example indicates, some of these apologies relate to actions in the distant past, including actions occurring at times well before the dates of birth of all current group members.

This phenomenon of collective apology is politically controversial. In Australia, for example, there is considerable debate about the appropriateness of an apology by the Australian government for harm done to Indigenous Australians. The issue of apology centres on a recommendation of the inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families in 1997 that all Australian parliaments should apologize to Indigenous persons and communities affected by the practice of systematic separation of children from their families. The Australian population is divided over the question of an official apology by the Commonwealth (national) Government with approximately 52% opposed to an official apology in 2000 (Nielsen Polls, 2000, the time at which the data to be reported here were collected). Alongside the debate about an official apology there has grown a popular movement in Australia amongst non-Indigenous Australians to apologize personally for past wrongs committed by others in the past, especially to members of the ‘stolen generations’ who were forcibly removed from their families. These personal apologies usually take the form of signing sorry books on National Sorry Day.

Group-based guilt as a basis of apology
There are many and varied reasons why people might apologize. Norrick (1978), for example, suggests that apologizing serves broad social functions in societies such as averting wrath or expressing a social nicety. Augoustinos and LeCouteur (2004), however, summarize the sociological and philosophical literature to conclude that apologies:

can be constructed as acts that involve the absence of a denial, or mitigation of responsibility for an offense. On the contrary, in this version, an apology requires the acknowledgement of wrong or offensive actions, and a declaration of regret and sorrow.

Augoustinos and LeCouteur (2004) add that Searle, in his 1969 book, argues further that apologies usually go beyond merely acknowledging responsibility and regret (even though a sincere expression of sorrow or regret was deemed to be crucial for a genuine apology by Searle, 1976). Apologies are usually made with the further illocutionary point of allowing the apologizer to be freed from guilt (see also Iyer, Leach, & Pedersen, 2004).

There are, of course, disputes within the philosophical and linguistic literatures about the importance of certain issues for defining apology. Owen (1983) takes issue with some of Searle's conditions for defining apology as a speech act and also takes issue with Norrick's (1978) suggestion that apologies have social functions (such as averting wrath or getting someone off the hook) that can be distinguished from illocutionary force. In part though, the practical political controversy in Australia about apology rests on a lay analysis of the foregoing social psychological, philosophical, and linguistic concepts. In broad terms, the view of some scholars that apologies should only be deemed to be genuine and appropriate responses where the apologizer sincerely experiences negative emotions such as guilt in relation to the actions for which responsibility is also supported or contested by political commentators, politicians, and members of the public.

Other people reject this view and argue (in a way that is sympathetic to the concerns raised by Norrick, 1978) that apologies can be valid because they fulfil social functions such as conveying sympathy or empathy or to demonstrate compliance with norms of social politeness (and this argument was made by some of the respondents in an online discussion of apology studied by Augoustinos & LeCouteur, 2004). Tavuchis (1991), on the other hand, agrees that sorrow or remorse is essential for individual apologies but he also notes that collective apologies (apologies of the many to the many) can be discussed quite adequately without making reference to these factors. It appears arguable then that guilt could be strongly or weakly implicated in apology depending on the view of what constitutes an adequate apology. The existence of such a debate makes it all the more important to establish what the relationship between group-based guilt and support for apology is. If guilt is essential for sincere apology then we would expect a strong relationship, if it is unnecessary then we would expect a relatively weak relationship.

What then is group-based guilt, and what is the evidence that it exists? We should first make it clear that we are referring to the emotional response of feeling bad about actions, and not to a legal definition of whether someone is responsible for an action. Group-based guilt is associated with propositions of the form, ‘I feel guilty about undesirable actions performed by other members of a group I belong to’, and where this psychological state is also consensually attributed to other in-group members, that, ‘We feel guilty about undesirable actions performed by our group’. Such statements are perfectly logical according to the framework provided by self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987; see also Turner, Oakes, Haslam, & McGarty, 1994). This theory holds that the self has many levels, and that while psychological states only occur within individuals (see Asch, 1952), nevertheless expressions of a more inclusive, social sense of self are just as valid as expressions of a personal self. It is customary to establish the existence of social identity by measures of social identification: the degree to which a person feels a membership in and commitment to some group combined with a degree of positive feelings about that group (see e.g. Ellemers, Kortekaas, & van Ouwerkerk, 1999).

Branscombe, Doosje, and McGarty (2002) argue that group-based guilt about the in-group's past mistreatment of a disadvantaged group arises where the in-group has clear responsibility for a harmful disadvantage that continues over time. Evidence of this kind of group-based guilt comes from the work of Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, and Manstead (1998). They showed that Dutch students expressed guilt about their in-group's colonial occupation of Indonesia in the past or about the harm done by an experimentally created in-group. In both cases Doosje et al. found group-based guilt predicted support for material restitution to the harmed out-group (see also Iyer, Leach, & Crosby, 2003). In the case of Dutch colonialism, group-based guilt also seemed to lead participants to support the idea of the Dutch government paying financial compensation to Indonesia.

Given that apology is a form of moral restitution (Iyer et al., 2004), group-based guilt may play an important role in the debate over apology in Australia. Previous theory and research suggest that feelings of guilt are likely among those members of the advantaged group (in this case non-Indigenous Australians) who perceive their in-group as being unfairly advantaged (Iyer et al., 2003, Study 1). We examine this in Study 1. Theory and research also suggest that perceiving the non-Indigenous in-group as responsible for harming Indigenous people or perceiving the harm to Indigenous people as harsh should increase group-based guilt (for a review, see Leach, Snider, & Iyer, 2002). We examine these possibilities in Study 2.

If guilt is tied to intent to make restitution, non-Indigenous Australians' feelings of group-based guilt should predict both support for personal apologies as well as support for collective restitution in the form of an official government apology. Indeed, Roger (1999) has shown that group-based guilt predicted willingness to add one's name to an internet ‘Sorry’ page relating to the stolen generations. Thus we examine guilt as a predictor of official apology in Studies 1 and 2 and personal apology in Study 1. The Australian context also makes clear, however, that guilt is not universally experienced and apology is not uniformly supported.

Guilt avoidance
As group-based guilt is an unpleasant feeling, people are likely to avoid it if they can (Leach et al., 2002). It appears that those most invested in seeing their in-group in a positive light are most likely to avoid feelings of guilt and are least intent on making restitution (for a review, see Zebel, Doosje, & Spears, 2004). For example, Doosje et al. (1998) found that those Dutch who were most identified with their group expressed the least group-based guilt and regret when the history of Dutch colonial occupation was presented in an ambiguous manner (with positive and negative features). This finding is interesting because, even though guilt was a collective phenomenon, it was experienced by people who were less committed to the (national) group. Recent thinking suggests that highly identified members of groups that can be seen as responsible for others' mistreatment may avoid guilt through several different means (see Branscombe & Miron, 2004; Iyer et al., 2004). We discuss three guilt avoidance strategies below.

Minimizing harm and in-group responsibility
Perceiving one's in-group as responsible for the harmful mistreatment of another group is an important basis of guilt. This feeling may be avoided, however, by downplaying the harshness of the harm and the in-group's responsibility for it (Branscombe & Miron, 2004; Leach et al., 2002). Given that being part of a group responsible for harmful and unfair discrimination presents a threat to social identity, highly identified members may be moved to minimize these possibilities and thereby avoid the threat of guilt (Branscombe et al., 2002). Thus, in Study 2 we examine how group identity may be associated with guilt avoidance by means of minimizing the harshness of the harm done or the in-group's responsibility for it.

Questioning the appropriateness of group-based guilt
As can be seen in the quote from John Howard that began this paper, opponents of official apology argue that it is impossible to feel guilt about something for which one is not personally responsible. The motion of Parliament that Howard was addressing contained an acknowledgement of past wrongs and an expression of sorrow and regret but it has never been interpreted as an apology. This is mainly because it explicitly denied a sense of responsibility for, or feelings of guilt about, the harm done to Indigenous people (see Iyer et al., 2004). As past generations were seen as solely responsible for past harm, it was argued that Australians today should not feel guilt. Indeed, according to Howard's argument, it is unjust to expect them to do so. Although this same argument does not appear to forestall feelings of pride about a group's achievements in the past, doubting the appropriateness of collective responsibility for past harm and the historical continuity of group identity may be an effective way to avoid guilt (Leach et al., 2002). We examine this possibility in Study 2 and assess to what degree those who are highly identified with their nationality engage in this strategy.

Concern about the potential cost of apology
Opponents of apology also make more practical arguments against it. For example, some say that an official apology would have high legal and financial costs because it would open the way to Indigenous claims for material restitution. Despite the fact that all eight Australian state and territory legislatures have made formal apologies without incurring such costs, emphasizing concern for the potential cost of apology may be an effective way to limit support for it and perhaps to avoid feelings of guilt (see Schmitt, Branscombe, & Brehm, 2004). Therefore, in Study 2 we assess concern for the material cost of apology and examine to what degree those who are highly identified with their nationality emphasize this way of guilt and restitution avoidance.

We report two studies of non-Indigenous support for apology to Indigenous Australians that were formulated independently by different teams of researchers and use different measures and research strategies. The results, however, make very similar points and so we have presented them in parallel. There were, however, a couple of key differences. The focus of the first study is on apology for past actions (including events within the lifetimes of many Australians) whereas the focus of the second study was on apology for colonial era treatment in the 19th century before any of the participants were born. In exploring apology, the first study examines relative advantage and demographic variables in a community sample and the second study examines group identification and guilt avoidance strategies as antecedents of guilt and apology.

STUDY 1
In this study, we were interested in whether perceived in-group advantage and group-based guilt were related to support for an official apology by the federal government for past treatment of Aborigines. We were also interested in whether any of the socio-demographic variables that are often linked with prejudice predicted support for an official apology. For example, lower levels of formal education, increased age, right-wing political orientation, and being male have all been linked with prejudice (Pedersen, Beven, Walker, & Griffiths, 2004, Study 2). It is worth noting, however, that effect sizes are often small.

We organized potential predictors of support for a federal apology into three categories that varied in their predictive proximity. The first group of predictors consisted of distal socio-demographic variables, including age, education level, gender, income, and political affiliation (see Leach, 1995; Pedersen, Contos, Griffiths, Bishop, & Walker, 2000; Pedersen & Walker, 1997; Pettigrew et al., 1998).

Perceived in-group advantage constituted a more proximal predictor, as those who perceive non-Indigenous Australians as advantaged relative to Indigenous people should be more likely to feel group-based guilt (e.g. Iyer et al., 2003, Study 1). Or, put another way, if one does not see the in-group as advantaged there is less to feel guilt about. It is also likely that perceiving non-Indigenous Australians as relatively advantaged should directly predict support for apology, as perceiving inequality should be associated with support of efforts designed to ameliorate or at least make restitution for it (Iyer et al., 2003).

The final, and most proximate, predictor is the feeling of group-based guilt. Given the strong connection between feelings of guilt and the intention to make restitution, we expected group-based guilt to be associated with stronger support for an official apology. Although personal guilt has been shown to increase intentions of personal apology (e.g. Roseman, Wiest, & Swartz, 1994), a link between group-based guilt and official (group representative) apology has not previously been shown. Given previous findings that group-based guilt partially mediates the effect of perceived group advantage on support for restitution through material compensation (Iyer et al., 2003), we also expected guilt to partially mediate the effect of relative advantage on support for an official apology in Australia.

Method
Procedure
A random sample of 500 Perth residents was selected from electoral rolls. A questionnaire and accompanying letter were sent to residents in July 2000. Two weeks later a reminder letter was sent. A total of 164 questionnaires were returned, giving a response rate of 33%.

Questionnaire
The questionnaire measured support for a federal apology, socio-demographic variables, perceived relative advantage, and group-based guilt.

Support for federal apology
Respondents were asked, ‘Do you think the Federal Government should say “sorry” for past actions?’ Responses were given on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = the Government should apologize; 7 = the Government should not apologize). Participants were also asked to make open-ended comments to explain their views on apology.

Socio-demographics
Respondents were asked to state their age in years, their education level (1 = primary school only, 5 = university), income (1 = under 10,000 dollars, 7 = over 50,000), political party affiliation (coded from left-wing to right-wing on this issue 1 = Australian Democrats/Greens, 2 = Labour Party, 3 = Liberal/National, 4 = One Nation Party), and sex (coded 0 = male, 1 = female).

Relative advantage
In order to assess perceived group advantage, respondents were asked the following question: ‘Do you think non-Aborigines are advantaged, or disadvantaged, compared to Aborigines?’ Responses were given on a 7-point bipolar scale anchored by ‘1’ (Non-Aborigines advantaged) and ‘7’ (‘Aborigines advantaged’). These values were recoded so that higher numbers indicated greater perceived advantage for non-Indigenous people.

Group-based guilt
We used Masser's (2000) adaptation of Swim and Miller's (1999) 4-item scale. The items were: ‘I feel guilty about the past and present social inequality of Aborigines’, ‘I do not feel guilty about the social inequality between Aborigines and non-Aboriginal Australians’, ‘When I learn about racism, I feel guilty due to my association with non-Aborigines’, and ‘I feel guilty about the benefits and privileges that I receive as a non-Aboriginal Australian’. Unlike Masser, we used the term ‘non-Aboriginal’ in this study rather than ‘White’ given the multicultural nature of the Perth community. Responses were given on a 5-point Likert-type scale anchored by ‘1’ (strongly disagree) and ‘5’ (strongly agree). This scale proved reliable (α=.80).

Participants
There were approximately equal numbers of males (80) and females (83) with one missing datum. Respondents were aged between 20 years and 90 years, and had a mean age of 48 years. Overall respondents were quite well-educated (47% had attended or were attending post-secondary or university education) and 79% of respondents had at least completed secondary school. The majority of respondents (74%) were supporters of the two dominant Australian political parties in approximately the same proportion (Labor 35% and Liberal/National 39%). Fewer participants were supporters of the more left-wing Democrat and Green parties (14%) or the more right-wing One Nation party (5%). Supporters of independent candidates (7%), who are more difficult to classify in terms of ideological leanings, were excluded from analyses.

Results
Scale descriptives
Descriptive statistics for all measures are reported in Table 1. To rule out floor and ceiling effects that would constrain relationships it is important to note the mean-levels of perceived advantage, guilt, and apology support. On average participants saw Indigenous Australians as slightly less advantaged than non-Indigenous people, although this mean was very close to the scale mid-point. Put another way, 43% of participants saw Aborigines as advantaged, 36% saw non-Aborigines as advantaged, and 21% saw no difference. Participants did not report high levels of guilt or strong support for an official apology. In fact, the sample reported general disagreement with group-based guilt (only 14% of participants scored above the scale mid-point) and fairly strong opposition to an official apology (only 27% of people expressed explicit support).

Correlations
Not surprisingly, several of the predictors of support for apology were correlated with each other (see Table 1). Interestingly, several socio-demographic variables were associated with the social psychological measures. For example, a higher level of education was associated with higher perceptions of group advantage. People with more right-wing political party affiliations perceived less group advantage, expressed less group-based guilt, and less support for an apology. Women reported greater group-based guilt than men and more support for an official apology. In addition, consistent with our conceptualization, perceived group advantage, group-based guilt, and support for apology were all positively correlated with each other.

Results
Hierarchical multiple regression
To examine the predictors of support for a federal apology, we performed a hierarchical multiple regression analysis with each of the three blocks of predictors entered in succession. The results are shown in Table 2, where standardized regression coefficients are reported to facilitate the interpretation of variables measured with different scales. When entered as a first block, some socio-demographic variables predicted support for a federal apology, F(5, 119)=5.82, p<.001. More specifically, those who supported more right-wing parties were less supportive of apology (β=−0.289, p=.001) as were men (β=−0.195, p=.08).

Perceiving non-Indigenous Australians as relatively advantaged added predictive power to the model, R2 change=.20, p<.001. The greater the advantage they perceived their group as having over Indigenous people the more supportive non-Indigenous Australians were of apology (β=0.467, p<.001).

Finally, feeling guilt as a non-Indigenous Australian also added predictive power to the model, R2 change=.05, p<.001. Independent of socio-demographics and perceived group advantage, greater non-Indigenous guilt predicted stronger support for a federal apology (β=0.284, p<.002). It is important to note however, that perceived advantage remained statistically significant (β=0.337, p<.001). This result is consistent with the possibility that guilt partially mediates the effect of group advantage on apology support. That the socio-demographic predictors, such as gender and political affiliation, were no longer statistically significant predictors suggested that their effects on apology support might be fully mediated by guilt.

Mediation analyses
To examine the possibility that non-Indigenous guilt partially mediated the effect of perceived advantage, we performed a mediation analysis with OLS multiple regression. Importantly, perceived advantage predicted the hypothesized mediator of guilt, β=0.575, p<.001. And, most importantly, the association between perceived advantage and apology was attenuated when guilt was also a predictor, β=0.306 p<.001. This attenuated predictive power was statistically significant as shown by the Sobel test statistic with the unstandardized coefficients, =4.44, p=.000009. This suggests that guilt partially mediated the effect perceived advantage had on apology. Thus, part of the reason perceived advantage predicts support for an apology is that perceived advantage predicts non-Indigenous Australians feelings of group-based guilt. To offer further support for the role of guilt as a partial mediator, we compared our hypothesized model to one that inverted the roles of the predictors of apology, proposing relative advantage as the mediator of guilt. In this alternative model, relative advantage was a significant, but less strong mediator of guilt. Thus, guilt's prediction of support for apology (β=0.575, p<.001) was reduced when relative advantage was also a predictor, β=0.401, p<.001. But, relative advantage was a less strong and less significant mediator of guilt than vice versa, Sobel test statistic = 3.62, p=.0003.

Parallel mediation analyses suggested that the socio-demographic variables of political affiliation and gender had effects on apology support that were fully mediated by guilt. Thus, right-wing political affiliation predicted the hypothesized mediator of guilt, β=−0.260, p<.001. And the association between political affiliation and apology support was made non-significant when guilt was also a predictor, β=−0.126, p=.08. The attenuation of the predictive power of political affiliation was statistically significant as shown by the Sobel test statistic = 2.98, p=.003. An alternative model proposing political affiliation as a mediator of guilt was not supported, Sobel test statistic = 1.55, p=.12. (Male) gender also predicted the hypothesized mediator of guilt, β=−0.154, p=.05. And the association between gender and apology was made non-significant when guilt was also a predictor, β=−0.101, p=.10. The attenuation of the predictive power of gender was statistically marginal as shown by the Sobel test statistic = 1.92, p=.055. An alternative model proposing gender as a mediator of guilt was not supported, Sobel test statistic = 1.20, p=.23. Thus, results suggested that right-wing political affiliation and male gender predicted less support for apology because they felt less guilt about non-Indigenous group advantage.

Discussion
This study was designed to assess the predictors of support for an official apology for Australia's mistreatment of Indigenous people. In a sample survey of the Perth metropolitan area, we examined socio-demographics, perceived group advantage, and non-Indigenous guilt as predictors. At the socio-demographic level, we found women and those with a more left-wing political orientation to show greater support of an official apology.

Most importantly for our purposes, independent of the effects of socio-demographics and perceived in-group advantage, feelings of group-based guilt predicted support for an official apology. Thus, greater feelings of guilt about non-Indigenous Australians' group advantage over Indigenous people was associated with more support for an official effort to apologize for past mistreatment of Indigenous people.

There was also a significant relationship between support for an apology and the perception of relative advantage, although guilt partially mediated the overall effect. Given previous research this result was to be expected. Participants who saw themselves as advantaged may have been more likely to support an apology especially if they saw it as ameliorating disadvantage (but see Iyer et al., 2004).

Although our results establish a strong link between group-based guilt and official apology, the direction of this link is sensitive to the particular positions adopted. Indeed, it is important to remember that the present sample expressed relatively little overall endorsement of guilt or support for an official apology. Indeed, there was fairly strong opposition to guilt and apology. The lack of community guilt is in line with recent research such as that by Augoustinos and LeCouteur (2004) who examined the denial of White guilt in relation to the question of whether an apology was appropriate towards Indigenous Australians. In their qualitative research they found that many communicators rejected the notion of guilt (either personal or collective) arguing that ‘present generations cannot be blamed for the mistakes of past generations’. Given that guilt is a self-blaming emotion that is aversive in nature it is likely that people will be predisposed to avoid it (Iyer et al., 2004).

When the association between guilt and apology is considered in the context of this low mean-level of support, it appears that our results tell us a great deal about how the link between guilt and apology may fuel opposition to both. Thus, just as the link between guilt and apology leads those who endorse guilt to support apology, so too are those who oppose group-based guilt likely also to oppose official apology. The strong link between opposition to guilt and opposition to apology may be based in a notion that the expression of guilt almost necessitates apology or some other form of restitution (Frijda, 1986; Leach et al., 2002). As such, opposition to guilt serves as the basis for opposition to apology. This was suggested in LeCouteur and Augoustinos's (2001) analysis of opinions e-mailed to a newspaper regarding the question of official apology in Australia. Their work suggests that people opposed to saying sorry defined an apology as implying group-based guilt. Thus, opposition to an apology was explained as opposition to feelings of guilt based in people's group membership as non-Indigenous Australians. That opposition to official apology can be based in opposition to group-based guilt only serves to strengthen the conceptual link between the two.

In short, Study 1 adds to previous research in an important way. We found a significant and strong relationship between group-based guilt and support for an official apology to Indigenous Australians, as well as between the perception of advantage and support for an apology. Yet socio-demographic predictors were generally weaker predictors than the social psychological variables; in fact, gender was the only socio-demographic variable to have a direct independent relationship with support for an apology.

This strong link between guilt and support for an apology is an important finding because, as we argued in the introduction, there are others ways to justify and support apology (as a norm of politeness or as an expression of sympathy). Yet there still remain unanswered questions relating to the importance of other predictors of support for apology such as perceptions of responsibility and guilt avoidance. This brings us to Study 2.

STUDY 2
The second study focuses on the antecedents of group-based guilt as predictors of support for both collective and personal apologies. To do this we recruited a sample of convenience which contained a wide variation of opinions about apology. Of course, such a sample cannot tell us what the levels of support for different types of apology are in the Australian population, but it can be informative about the psychological processes that are implicated in support for apology. Furthermore, the results from Study 1 showed that the psychological variables were much better predictors than the socio-demographic variables (as was also found by Pedersen & Walker, 1997). On this basis it is reasonable to use a sample that is more homogeneous in socio-demographics (providing that there is still wide variation in the relevant psychological variables).

We were also interested in exploring a different set of antecedents of group-based guilt. We have seen in Study 1 that perceiving non-Indigenous Australians as relatively advantaged predicts group-based guilt and support for apology. In Study 2 we examined perceived responsibility for the harm done to Indigenous Australians in the past as the basis of group-based guilt. As in Study 1 this group-based guilt is expected to mediate the effect of perceived harm on support for apology. Our predictions can be summarized in terms of the following model. The core of the model is that beliefs that harm has been done, and that the privileged group is responsible, give rise to group-based guilt amongst members of this group which in turn predicts support for apology (a form of atonement or restitutive action). In other words, group-based guilt should mediate the relationship between harm done by one's group and apology. This model is broadly consistent with other work on group-based and personal guilt and atonement (see Branscombe et al., 2002).

The key extension that we explore to this model is that identification with the privileged group can lead to guilt avoidance. Doosje et al. (1998) discuss one strategy that might be adopted involving a reinterpretation of the past. They argue:

When both favourable and unfavourable aspects of their group's past colonial behaviour are introduced, there is more scope for low and high identifiers to focus on different aspects of the information and thereby to respond to it differently. We predicted that in this ambiguous situation, high identifiers would be relatively likely to display defensive behaviour. They should be less willing to accept the negative aspects of the information about their group and should thus perceive more intragroup variability (p. 879).

Doosje et al.'s results supported this proposition. They found that when Dutch high identifiers were presented with an ambiguous version of the history of the Dutch colonial occupation of Indonesia that they experienced less group-based guilt and saw more variability within the behaviour of the Dutch people during the colonial occupation. There is also plenty of evidence of this form of discourse in Australia where the scale of past harm has been questioned and the positive intentions of non-Indigenous Australians have been asserted (see LeCouteur & Augoustinos, 2001). It is possible that non-Indigenous Australians who are high identifiers with Australia may be less likely to experience guilt or support apology because they feel this would embarrass Australia.

There are two other guilt avoidance strategies, however, that are prominent in the Australian context. One of these is to attack the idea of group-based guilt, that is, to raise doubts about the appropriateness of feeling sorry for something you are not personally responsible for, and the speech by the Prime Minister of Australia quoted at the beginning of this paper is an excellent example of this. The other strategy is to attack the idea of apology as something which may have high costs (e.g. by establishing legal liability). We sought to measure these latter two forms of guilt avoidance. We anticipate that these two conditions would undermine the antecedent conditions for guilt by reducing perceived harm and responsibility but they would themselves be predicted by national identification. This follows if we assume that the guilt avoidance strategies are group-based responses that we would expect committed group members to support. Thus, non-Indigenous Australians who identify strongly with Australia should be more likely to doubt whether group-based guilt is appropriate and more likely to believe that an apology would be costly.

Method
Participants
The participants were male and female adults sampled between October 1999 and July 2000 (within 12 months of the key parliamentary debate on apology). The sample was collected in two ways. The first 70 participants were recruited by third year psychology students from their personal acquaintances in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). This sample was supplemented with a sample of 90 first-year psychology students (the results from these two subsamples are very similar so they have been collapsed in the subsequent results). Of the 158 participants who provided data on Indigenous/non-Indigenous status and nationality, 28 Indigenous Australians1 and 18 people with dual nationalities or nationalities which were other than Australian were dropped from the sample. This left a sample of 116 respondents of whom 63% were female. The mean age of the sample was 24.97 (median 20) years, 95% of the respondents were born in Australia, 69% of them had both parents born in Australia, but only 49% were sure that some of their ancestors had lived in Australia in the 19th century.

Questionnaire
The questionnaire labelled ‘Attitudes to Australian History’ was divided into four sections. These were a national identification scale, a presentation of the history of the treatment of Indigenous Australians in the 19th century accompanied by some measures of perceived wrongdoing and responsibility for past wrongs, a group-based guilt scale, and a set of supplementary items measuring support for apology and socio-demographic characteristics.

Identification scale
An important methodological question here was which group to measure identification in relation to. Given that any official apology would come from the Australian government on behalf of the Australian people, and that terms for the perpetrator groups such as White, Anglo-Celtic and non-Indigenous are problematic due to their connotations or non-applicability to many of the respondents, we decided to measure national identification and thus specifically used the category ‘Australian’ in the scale.

The scale was based on the seven items used by Doosje et al. (1998). The items were, ‘I identify with other Australians’, ‘I see myself as an Australian’, ‘I feel strong ties with Australian people’, ‘I am glad to be an Australian’, ‘I see Australia as an important group for me’, ‘Being Australian is an important part of how I see myself’, and ‘Being Australian just feels natural to me’. A 5-point scale labelled strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree was used for these and all other (non-demographic) items.

Past wrongs
A brief presentation of the history of colonization of Australia in the 19th century was provided on the second page. The 19th century was chosen as the focus rather than the forcible removal of children because previous research had suggested that some participants argued that some other non-indigenous Australians should feel guilt in relation to that because they had conducted or tolerated these activities during their life times. By focusing on the 19th century colonization, we chose matters for which no living Australian could be held directly responsible.

The background information took the following form:

Indigenous Australians have suffered very harsh treatment since the commencement of European colonization of Australia. Much of this harsh treatment occurred during the 19th century. During that time Australia was a set of colonies that were largely administered by non-indigenous Australians. The official policy was that Australia was considered to be unoccupied land. This meant that it was considered acceptable for actions against Indigenous Australians that would now be classified as genocide to take place. Hostile treatment included the poisoning of waterholes and the active hunting of Indigenous Australians in many regions. Many of the actions that resulted in the deaths of Indigenous Australians throughout the 19th century followed directly from policies of the time. In other cases non-indigenous Australian officials failed to take any steps to stop hostility towards indigenous Australians.

Respondents were asked whether they agreed that the statement was an accurate portrayal of the treatment of indigenous Australians in the 19th century, whether they agreed that indigenous Australians were treated harshly in the 19th century, and whether they thought non-indigenous Australians of the time were primarily to blame for the negative things done to indigenous Australians in the 19th century. The last two of these were intended to measure the acceptance that the group was responsible for past wrongs.

Guilt and other items
The group-based guilt scale was based on four items taken from the work of Doosje et al. (1998). This uses different items but is closely related to the scale used in Study 1. Two items referred to regret and two to guilt. The two regret items were, ‘I think Non-Indigenous Australians should feel regret for the harmful actions of their group toward Indigenous Australians in the 19th Century’, and ‘I think Non-Indigenous Australians should feel regret about things their group did to Indigenous Australians in the 19th Century’. The two guilt items were ‘I think Non-Indigenous Australians today should feel guilty about the negative things done to Indigenous Australians in the 19th Century’, and ‘I think Non-Indigenous Australians should feel guilty about the bad outcomes suffered by Indigenous Australians which were brought about by Non-Indigenous Australians in the 19th Century’.

Participants were also asked to complete three items relating to doubts about the appropriateness of group-based guilt (‘I think that only people who were directly involved should feel guilty about incidents in the past’ and ‘I think it is sometimes appropriate to feel guilty about things your group has done even if you were not personally involved’; a reverse-scored item and ‘I think 19th Century Non-Indigenous Australians are not comparable with Australians at the present time’).

Participants were then asked several questions about apologizing. The first three items, relating to the perceived cost of apology, were ‘I think that apologizing for the harsh treatment of Indigenous Australians in the past will create problems for Australia in the international community’, ‘I think that apologizing for the harsh treatment of Indigenous Australians in the 19th Century will create compensation claims that Australia cannot afford to pay’, and ‘I think that apologizing for the harsh treatment of Indigenous Australians in the 19th Century will improve Australia's image overseas’. The last of these items was reverse scored. The next two measured support for personal apology, ‘I would embrace the opportunity to say sorry for the previous behaviour of Non-Indigenous Australians towards Indigenous Australians’, and for official apology, ‘I think the Australian Government should apologize to Indigenous Australians’.

Finally, the participants were asked a range of socio-demographic questions. These related to their gender, age, nationality, whether they were born in Australia, whether both their parents were born in Australia, whether any of the ancestors lived in Australia in the 19th century (the options being ‘yes’, ‘no’, and ‘not sure’) and whether they were a non-indigenous Australian.

Results
Preliminary analyses
Responses on all Likert scales were converted to a 5-point scale with strongly disagree=1 and strongly agree=5. Acceptable to good Cronbach's α coefficients of .91 for identification, .79 for guilt, and .77 for perceived cost of apology were obtained. For doubts about group-based guilt a marginal α for the 3-item scale of .67 was obtained. Means, standard deviations and correlations are shown in Table 3.

There had been some controversy in Australia at the time about the difference between regret and guilt. We found that the means for the two regret items (3.87) were higher than the means for the two guilt items, M=2.81, t(114)=10.75, p<.001, and that the correlation between the two subscales was only of moderate size, r=.40, p<.001, but that otherwise the results reported below were very similar regardless of whether the 4-item guilt scale was used or when the two regret items were dropped. For comparability with previous research we have therefore used the 4-item scale.

Key preconditions for tests of the model were that (a) participants should accept the accuracy of the presentation of the history (i. e. accept that there had been some harm) and (b) there should be a wide range of positions on the issue of apology. In relation to the first issue only 6% of participants disagreed with the accuracy of the statement (from Table 3, M(agreement)=4.03, SD=0.80) and only 0.9% disagreed that the treatment was harsh (M(harsh)=4.52, SD=0.60). In terms of the second issue, support for an official apology ranged from strong disagreement to agreement with a mean of 3.85 and a median of 4, (SD=1.11, interquartile range of 3–5). This suggests that the sample was pro-apology but that 25% were opposed. The zero-order correlation between support for a personal and government apology was large, r(114)=.75, p<.001 so these measures were combined to create a single measure of support for apology.

We were also keen to rule out one additional source of heterogeneity in the sample which relates to whether participants had ancestors in Australia during the 19th century. We compared the 57 participants who had responded ‘yes’ with the 59 who responded ‘no’ or ‘don't know’ to the question about ancestors. These subsamples did not differ in level of support for personal or government apology or in the level of group-based guilt.

Main analyses
The prediction of guilt avoidance strategies. The preliminary part of our more general model is that identification with the responsible group leads to guilt avoidance in the form of concerns about cost of apology and doubts about group-based guilt, which undermines the antecedent conditions for group-based guilt. The zero-order correlations in Table 3 show identification is positively (but weakly) related to the perceived cost of apology (r=.20, p<.05) and doubts about group-based guilt (r=.26, p<.05), but identification is unrelated to the postulated preconditions of group-based guilt and to group-based guilt itself (all r<.10).

Testing the core model
Given the high correlation between the two apology measures we conducted structural equation modelling using the two apology items as a combined indicator of support for apology. These analyses suggested a modified model where identification predicted cost of apology and doubts about guilt. Perceived harshness, group responsibility and doubts about guilt were predictors of group-based guilt which, along with the cost of apology was a direct predictor of support for apology. Fit was improved by allowing the error terms for doubt about guilt and cost of apology to be correlated with each other (r=.38) and with harshness and group responsibility (−.16 and −.21 for doubt and −.45 and −.52 for cost). The final model, which had acceptable fit statistics, χ2(8)=15.22, p=.055, CFI=.976, RSMEA=.089, is shown in Fig. 1 (these statistics dropped slightly when the two regret items were dropped from the guilt scale). Note that the model provides excellent prediction of both group-based guilt (R2=.55) and support for apology (R2=.62).

Discussion
The results show strong support for a slight modification of the core model. A belief that non-Indigenous Australians were responsible for the harsh treatment of Indigenous Australians predicted group-based guilt and group-based guilt in turn predicted support for apology at both the personal and governmental levels. However, both group-based guilt and support for apology were apparently undermined by relevant forms of guilt avoidance. People who doubted the appropriateness of the emotion felt less guilt and those who had concerns about the cost of apology were less likely to support it.

We say apparently undermined because we have no basis for determining the true causal order in relation to this matter. More specifically in this case, the correlations between the error terms raise the possibility that there is some latent variable that might play a causal role in predicting group-based guilt and support for apology. Given the results of Study 1, doubts about the relative advantage of non-Indigenous Australians is but one plausible candidate.

Be that as it may, the study demonstrates strong relationships involving plausible preconditions and consequences of group-based guilt. On the other hand, the results appear to falsify part of our hypotheses relating identification to group-based guilt. While identification was positively associated with the two forms of guilt avoidance, and guilt avoidance were associated with group-based guilt and apology, identification was not a predictor of group-based guilt or apology. It seems safest to conclude that the perceived cost of apology is an independent predictor of support for apology but that it, along with doubts about group-based guilt, undermines group-based guilt and apology.

Theoretically speaking, although the results are inconsistent with Doosje et al. (1998) ideas in relation to identification (though see below) they lend considerable weight to the thrust of their other arguments. The results underscore the relevance of the concept of group-based guilt as a social psychological construct that is an excellent predictor of behavioural intentions and political attitudes.

As noted above though, identification was generally weakly related to the other variables. Two points are important here. First, identification was on average quite high. This truncation of range may have reduced the predictive power of the variable. Secondly, it is possible to argue that national identification is not the appropriate level at which to expect the relevant identification effects to occur. However the alternative labels White Australian and non-Indigenous Australian both entail methodological problems. The pilot research we have conducted on this matter suggests, however, that the choice of label makes relatively little difference to the strength of the relationships. Furthermore, the results do seem to rule out the possibility that guilt avoidance, at least for these participants, is tightly linked with threats to national identity experienced by Australian high identifiers, a matter we return to in the general discussion.

The other key methodological issue is the generalizability of the results here. Given our focus on the connection between the psychological processes we do not believe that this study provides a less strong basis for external methodological certainty (see Haslam & McGarty, 2001, 2003) than do other studies which use samples of convenience. Given the topical political content (in Australia at least), however, there may be some temptation to overgeneralize these results. For this reason we feel it is necessary to make the limitations of generalizability clear. We do not believe these results are informative about the levels of support for apology in the Australian non-Indigenous population: in particular the sample that we have collected is too young, too well-educated, and contains too few males. Having said that, we would expect that the relationships that we have observed would be able to be generalized quite widely, especially to urban, middle-class, educated non-Indigenous Australians.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
The results of these two studies put us in a relatively strong position to make some clear statements about the antecedents and consequences of group-based guilt. The fact that broadly similar relationships were found by independent research teams working at the same time with different measures and using very different sampling strategies puts us in a strong position to conclude that feelings of group-based guilt predict support for apology.

More specifically, Study 1 shows that group-based guilt only seems to be prevalent where the perpetrating group is perceived to have some continuing advantage. Study 2 shows, as anticipated in earlier work, that group-based guilt appears to arise from concerns that one's own group is responsible for the harsh treatment of another group. It also appears that group-based guilt (and its consequences in terms of support for an apology) can be undermined by concerns about the cost of apology and doubts about the concept of group-based guilt.

We interpreted the latter two variables as guilt avoidance responses that were driven by the current political debate about these issues. Despite the fact that both views are difficult to sustain they have been widely promulgated by politically conservative opinion leaders. The same can be said about relative advantage as examined in Study 1. Given the low life expectancy and income levels of Indigenous Australians it might seem difficult to sustain the proposition that they are relatively advantaged but such claims do abound within certain social and political strata in Australian society (as found by Pedersen & Walker, 1997).

It is worth noting that the rhetoric of Australian politicians (as studied in the case of John Howard by Augoustinos, LeCouteur, & Soyland, 2002) is being echoed in the scale responses of participants in Study 2. Of course, our argument is that when a respondent indicates agreement with a item expressing doubts about possibility of feeling guilt without personal responsibility they are expressing an attitude, but it would be naïve to fail to recognize that such a response can also be seen as echoing elite political discourse of the form that is contained in the quote that opens this paper. The existence of such rhetoric strengthens and maintains attitudes of the form we are interested in here, but it also serves to make such responses permissible to express and easier to articulate, thereby serving to sustain and legitimate inequality (Augoustinos et al. in part through the rhetorical strategy discussed by LeCouteur, Rapley, & Augoustinos, 2001, of clearly establishing the difference between two categories).

The social psychological function of expressing doubts about the appropriateness of guilt and pointing to the cost of apology is presumably to undermine the political movement that favours these methods for reconciliation. Although this pattern may be associated with conservative ideologies, Study 2 provides no evidence that it is associated with identification. This may be because identification is unrelated to the key variables or because national identification is a very complex thing that is associated with a wide diversity of ideas. Nations mean different things for different people (or even for the same people at different times, for a range of views see Condor, 2001; Hopkins, 2001; Mummendey, Klink & Brown, 2001a, 2001b; Reicher & Hopkins, 2001; Reicher, Hopkins, & Condor, 1997) and identification scales probably do not capture the special ideological flavour that is relevant to these processes. Moreover, the results suggest that, in line with the arguments of Sani and Reicher (2000), group identification need not contribute unambiguously to consensus. National identity is sufficiently broad, flexible, and contestable for the supporters and opponents of apology to argue that their preferred views are consistent with what it means to be Australian and, in the current political context, both groups can still find voice for their political programmes.

Nevertheless the existence of weak relationships between identification and group-based guilt (or worse still, strong negative relationships as found under some conditions by Doosje et al., 1998) does represent a paradox. If group-based guilt is indeed a group-based and group-normative phenomenon then it should be associated with commitment to group memberships. The work of Bliuc, McGarty, Musgrove, Reynolds, and Hendres (2004) on establishing the role of salient opinion groups in predicting group behaviour is informative here (see also McGarty & Bliuc, 2004). In essence the suggestion is we may need to look at other group memberships in order to understand the social identity-based dynamics of this situation. In particular, group-based guilt may be a group-normative response not so much of those committed to a broad social or racial category such as ‘Australians’ or ‘Whites’ but to a more specific political opinion-based group such as pro-reconciliation. Similarly, group-based guilt may be rejected by those who are committed to different political opinion groups (which may be only weakly correlated with formal political affiliations).

In this regard the evidence from Studies 1 and 2 that group-based guilt predicted support for an official apology is most interesting. The result suggests that group-based guilt, like other emotions, may serve as a basis for action (or at least a position supporting political action).

Despite its prominent role in support for restitution, however, group-based guilt may not be relevant to all forms of action. In fact, Iyer et al. (2004) argue that guilt is less useful for promoting political action that is not focused on restitution. As a result of guilt's narrow focus on group responsibility for harm and the resultant desire to make restitution, other group-based emotions may serve as more general bases of support for action against group inequality and mistreatment (Leach et al., 2002). Indeed, Iyer et al. (2003) showed sympathy (but not guilt) among White Americans predicted support for equal opportunity policies designed to increase African American's access to education and jobs.

It has also been argued that the aversive feeling of guilt may be too infrequently felt to serve as a general basis for political action (Iyer et al., 2004; Leach, et al., 2002). This seemed to be the case in Study 1, where less than one-fifth of respondents experienced group-based guilt. For these non-Indigenous Western Australians it was their rejection of guilt that predicted their lack of support for an official apology to Indigenous people. Study 1 suggested that this overall rejection of guilt was based, in part, on disagreement with the view that Indigenous Australians are disadvantaged. In fact, as in previous studies, there was a fairly widespread belief that Indigenous Australians are advantaged relative to their non-Indigenous counterparts (see also Pedersen & Walker, 1997). This perception of Indigenous advantage should not only undermine guilt but also fuel feelings of anger toward Indigenous people (Leach et al., 2002). In addition, these feelings of anti-Indigenous anger may have promoted intentions to engage in political action to oppose an official apology to Indigenous people. Finally, along with the further specification of the ideological preconditions for pro- and anti-apology positions, the role of group-based emotions in helping to facilitate (or inhibit) collective action are amongst the most interesting features that demand further research. Progress in these areas will rest on the solution to some intriguing theoretical and empirical problems.
